💡 “StudySensei — AI Cognitive Skill Growth Platform”

(A Powerful Learning Platform using Next.js + FastAPI + Supabase + PostgreSQL + Vector Search + Multi-Agent AI + Problem Solving + Docker)

This document is written in super-simple English 🧒 but still contains deep technical details 💻 so even a kid can understand what we are building and how we are building it.

📌 You can submit this as your project proposal + architecture + full implementation plan.
📌 You can use this as your engineering project report.
📌 You can give this directly to teammates to build the project.

🧠 What is StudySensei 2.0?

StudySensei 2.0 is a personal AI mentor platform where users can:

📌 Learn ANY skill (coding, finance, design, language, etc.)
📌 Upload resources (PDFs, lecture notes, links, text)
📌 Chat with their learning material using Artificial Intelligence
📌 Take smart quizzes automatically generated by AI
📌 Get progress reports, weak-area detection, and daily learning schedule
📌 Solve coding questions — AI runs the code and gives feedback
📌 Learn with friends through real-time collaboration

Simple idea → AI Tutor
Implementation → Complex Full-Stack + Multi-Agent AI System
